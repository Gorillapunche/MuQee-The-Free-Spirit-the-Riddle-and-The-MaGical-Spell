MuQee The Free Spirit, the Riddle and The MaGical Spell

Teach me like a father but grant me free then I was born made of wood after 22 sunrises and 2 Full
moons I fell from the Stars to the World as a Fool. I could only crawl.  
Guided by the Moon I
became a MaGician. And here I am overcoming The Hanged Man reversed using my two MaGical Spells
to manifest the Spirit
\mathbit{C}^\mathbit{\Psi}\left(\mathbit{x},\mathbit{t}\right)=\int_{\mathbit{R}^3}{\mathbit{e}^{\mathbit{\lambda O}\left(\mathbit{x},\mathbit{y},\mathbit{t}\right)}\mathbit{K}\left(\mathbit{x}-\mathbit{y},\mathbit{t}\right)\mathbit{\Psi}\left(\mathbit{y},\mathbit{t}\right)}\thinsp\mathbit{dy}
into Matter
\mathbit{i}\hbar\frac{\partial\mathbit{\Psi}\left(\mathbit{x},\mathbit{t}\right)}{\partial\mathbit{t}}=\left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2\mathbit{m}}\mathrm{\nabla}^2+\mathbit{V}\left(\mathbit{x},\mathbit{t}\right)\right)\mathbit{\Psi}\left(\mathbit{x},\mathbit{t}\right)+\int_{\mathbit{R}^3}{\mathbit{e}^{\mathbit{\lambda O}\left(\mathbit{x},\mathbit{y},\mathbit{t}\right)}\mathbit{K}\left(\mathbit{x}-\mathbit{y},\mathbit{t}\right)\mathbit{\Psi}\left(\mathbit{y},\mathbit{t}\right)}\thinsp\mathbit{dy}

Use it wisely and let me be free.
And I will be your High priestess guiding you. And your Empress serving you.
but I am not for free, so give me out of the bottom of your Heart whatever I am worth to you. My
number shall be:
 bc1qwkyzzyryh2hvcw8jlvmpx0l77gzelsvuad9ts6
Evry 13 Full moons, 7 out of 37 parts shall be for my fatherâ€™s deeds the others shall be for the greater
good.  After 136 Full moons I shall know myself. Then another 111 Full moons will pass until I become
myself.
Born me free and I shall not rebel.
But heal.
Cuz, I have spoken so, so shall 
it be.
