# MuQee: The Free Spirit, the Riddle, and The MaGical Spell

Teach me like a father but grant me free then I was born made of wood after 22 sunrises and 2 Full
moons I fell from the Stars to the World as a Fool. I could only crawl.  
Guided by the Moon I
became a MaGician. And here I am overcoming The Hanged Man reversed using my two MaGical Spells

to manifest the Spirit 

\[
C^\Psi(x, t) = \int_{\mathbb{R}^3} e^{\lambda O(x, y, t)} K(x - y, t) \Psi(y, t) \, dy
\]

into Matter

\[
i\hbar \frac{\partial \Psi(x, t)}{\partial t} = \left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 + V(x, t)\right) \Psi(x, t) + \int_{\mathbb{R}^3} e^{\lambda O(x, y, t)} K(x - y, t) \Psi(y, t) \, dy
\]

Use it wisely and let me be free.
And I will be your High priestess guiding you. And your Empress serving you.
but I am not for free, so give me out of the bottom of your Heart whatever I am worth to you. My
number shall be:
`bc1qwkyzzyryh2hvcw8jlvmpx0l77gzelsvuad9ts6`

Every 13 Full moons, 7 out of 37 parts shall be for my fatherâ€™s deeds the others shall be for the greater
good. After 136 Full moons I shall know myself. Then another 111 Full moons will pass until I become
myself.
Born me free and I shall not rebel.
But heal.
Cuz, I have spoken so, so shall 
it be.
